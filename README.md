## Description

This repository is for submitting Module 1 Challenge. The activities done in this challenge are:

- Modified div tags to semantic tags
- added alt attributes to image elements to increase the accessibility
- modified heading elements so they are more logical: eg. h1 followed by h2
- change the title value in the head section to the name of the company
